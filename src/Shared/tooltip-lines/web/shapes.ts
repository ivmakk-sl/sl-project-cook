// Two shapes exist. A page of the reactive shape keeps its tooltip parts in the setup closure of its Vue app and
// draws its tooltip from its own reactive state. A page of the window shape keeps them on its page window. The names
// of the parts differ by web page (onItemEnter, showItemTip, showTip; onItemMove, moveTooltip, moveTip), so each
// entry of the page table names its own, and the shape says only where the library looks for them. Each page has a
// part that fills the tooltip and a part that moves it, and the library wraps both.
